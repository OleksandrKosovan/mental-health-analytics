> What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness treatment?



# Answers

### 1.Ð¡onclusions from the visualization:

- The largest number of respondents from the United States. They are relatively equally distributed. UK and Canada are too.
- But indicators for other countries are not enough.
- So, we can't say that it depends on the location.We dont have enough information
- We need to pay attention on correlation with country. (no_employees: 0.31) , (work_interfere: -0.39)


### 2.We need to pay attention on next correlation:

(coworkers / phys_health_consequence: 0.57), (mental_health_consequence: 0.51), (treatment / family_history: 0.49), (coworkers / leave: -0.577)

I use LightgbmClassifier for prediction consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace. So, this model takes into account the following indicators:

- age
- no_employees
- leave
- work_interfere
